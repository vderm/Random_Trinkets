## Files
+ =Lamp light distribution point-by-point method.xlsx= Calculates the amount of light that falls onto a surface coming from a lamp. The user inputs the candela map of the map and specifies the grid spacing.
+ =simple_people_counter.py= OpenCV based people counter. Counts the number of blobs going either left-to-right or right-to-left. Only looks at the largest blob in an image. TODO: find and track features within the blob for better accuracy. TODO: consider number of people within the blob if of a certain size. Algorithm would otherwise work well for a low-traffic environment.
